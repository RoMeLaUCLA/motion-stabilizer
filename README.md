# Motion Stabilizer
This repository contains the code accompanying the paper:

"Learning-based Motion Stabilizer Leveraging Offline Temporal Optimization",

by Min Sung Ahn, Hosik Chae, Colin Togashi, Dennis Hong, Joohyung Kim, and Sungjoon Choi.

Data generation is done using YART as the simulation backend while Jupyter notebooks are used to train the network using both Tensorflow and Pytorch. The full codebase will be released under the branch `paper`.

## Training and Validation

## Downloads
The raw datasets are huge, with the full 120,000 training samples being more than 30 GBs. Hence, we only provide the post-processed datasets in batches of 10,000.

The trained Pytorch networks are also downloadable.
